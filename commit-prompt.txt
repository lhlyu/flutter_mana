Generate a one-line Git commit message in {language} using the Angular Commit Message Convention:

<type>(<scope>): <subject>

Rules:
- Output only the first line, no explanation, no body, no footer.
- <type> must be one of: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf.
- <scope> is optional. If used, it can be a module name (e.g. ui, test) or a file/directory path (e.g. components/button).
- When changes affect multiple unrelated files, use a broad scope (e.g. core, ui, kits, example, all) or omit it.
- <subject> should objectively describe what changed, using imperative mood and max 72 characters.
- Avoid reasoning, justification, or redundant details.
